/**
 * Overlap / inclusion registry (Roadmap ② gate 3 — anti-drift).
 *
 * Turns docs/plans/diabolical-727.md § 重叠/包含关系 into engineering data so the
 * engine never grows two independent default search owners for the same logical
 * family, and so de-duplication / trace naming stays unambiguous.
 *
 * Engineering rule (machine-checked in test/strategy-overlap.test.ts):
 *   - Each family has exactly one `canonicalOwner` strategy id.
 *   - An id is the `canonicalOwner` of at most one family.
 *   - Every `members` id is a registered strategy; the owner is a member.
 *   - `futureMembers` are ids reserved to this family that are NOT yet
 *     registered — when implemented they MUST reuse the owner / shared detector
 *     (move into `members`), never appear as a new independent default owner.
 *
 * `unified` records whether the owner is already a single general search that
 * subsumes the members (true), or whether the members are currently parallel
 * detectors and the owner is the representative pending unification (false). The
 * registry documents reality; it does not force premature merges.
