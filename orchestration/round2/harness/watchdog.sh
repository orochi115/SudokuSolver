# Belt-and-suspenders reaper for the round2 run. run-model already enforces
# wall-clock deadlines on the model call and verify; this catches hangs OUTSIDE
# those (npm install, git, between-steps) — e.g. a process left in a stalled
# syscall by laptop sleep. Every CHECK secs it looks at each model's pipeline.log;
# if it hasn't grown for WATCHDOG_STALL secs (WALL clock, so sleep counts), it
# kills that model's run-model subtree so the scheduler records STOP and advances
# (a fresh `run-all` re-attempts STOP phases — see run-all resume rule).
# Exits when the scheduler PID dies.
